## **📘 Masterplan: StudyFlow**

### **🧭 App Overview and Objectives**

StudyFlow is a responsive web app designed to help students—from elementary to university level—track study time, visualize academic progress, and manage key events. The mission is to support focused, balanced learning by combining time tracking with gentle motivation and stress relief tools.

* **Statistics Page**: Visual breakdowns (charts) of time spent by subject and timeframe

* **Calendar Page**: Manage upcoming tests and reminders with notification presets

* **Stress Relief Page**: Embedded ambient audio, motivational quotes, and guided breathing

### **🧱 High-Level Tech Stack**

* **Frontend**: React \+ TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Vite

* **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)

* **Authentication**: Email/password login; optional Google OAuth (future phase)

### **🧩 Conceptual Data Model**

* **Users**: email, password, displayName

### **🎨 User Interface Design Principles**

* Mobile-first layout

* Soft, calming colors and fonts (Inter)

* Minimalist spacing and lots of whitespace

* Smooth transitions and subtle animations

* Easy tap targets for mobile usability

### **🔐 Security Considerations**

* Supabase-authenticated user sessions

* Secure session management and database rules

* Basic email/password validation

* Protect study data with RLS (Row Level Security)

### **🚀 Development Phases / Milestones**

**Phase 1 – MVP**

* Homepage, Subjects Manager, Study Timer, Basic Stats

**Phase 2 – Feature Expansion**

* Calendar/reminder manager

* **Notifications**: Use local browser notifications or mock logic in early phase

### **🌱 Future Expansion Possibilities**

* Mobile app version

* Social study groups / shared calendars

* School/teacher dashboards for student groups
